# GearCheck

**GearCheck** is a WeakAura that you can share with your party/raid which will allow you to inspect other players wherever they are in the world. Both players need the WeakAura installed.

No more yelling for your raid to come to the center of Shattrath so that you can inspect them.

## How to Use

1. Import the WeakAura and share it with your party/raid.
2. Open your Character Pane
3. With the chat edit box open, _Shift+Click_ the **GearCheck** link button at the top right of your Character Pane
4. This will create a clickable link in chat.
5. Other users with the WeakAura can click this link to get a UI popup showing all equipped gear.
